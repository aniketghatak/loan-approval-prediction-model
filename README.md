# 🏦 Loan Approval Prediction Project

This project aims to predict whether a loan application will be approved or not based on various applicant details. It involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and building a machine learning model to make predictions.

## 📌 Project Overview

Financial institutions receive thousands of loan applications. Approving the right applications while minimizing risk is critical. In this project, we build a classification model that helps predict loan approval status based on historical data.

The project is structured in the following phases:

- 🧹 **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** (handling missing values, encoding, scaling)
- 📊 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using Seaborn, and Matplotlib
- 🤖 **Model Building** using Support Vector Classifier (SVC)

## 💡 Features Used

- Gender
- Marital Status
- Dependents
- Education
- Self-Employment
- Applicant Income
- Coapplicant Income
- Loan Amount
- Loan Term
- Credit History
- Property Area

## 🧠 ML Algorithm Used

- **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)** from Scikit-learn

## 📂 Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (SVM, train-test-split, standard scaler)

## ✅ Results

- The model predicts loan approvals with a good level of accuracy.
- Visualization of data distributions, relationships, and model performance helps interpret the insights clearly.
